# Error Handling
Error handling is an essential part of writing robust and reliable smart contracts. It involves handling unexpected or invalid conditions that may occur during contract execution and ensuring that the contract behaves predictably even in the presence of errors.It allows developers to handle exceptional situations and prevent unexpected behavior in their code. The contract demonstrates the basic functionality of a smart contract and showcases the use of events, require statements, and the revert function.

# Description
Solidity provides three main error handling mechanisms: require, assert, and revert.. It allows users to set and retrieve a value, and includes a function that always reverts. This contract can serve as a starting point for more complex smart contracts that require similar functionality.

# Getting Started
Executing program To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/. Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol).

contract Errorhandling {
    function requireStatement(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
        // The require statement checks a condition and reverts the transaction if it fails
        require(b != 0, "Division by zero is not allowed");
        uint256 result = a / b;
        return result;
    }
    
    function assertStatement(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 result = a + b;
        // The assert statement checks a condition and throws an error if it fails
        assert(result >= a);
        return result;
    }
    
    function revertStatement(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 result = a - b;
        // The revert statement reverts the transaction and returns the provided error message
        if (result < 0) {
            revert("Subtraction result cannot be negative");
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.0" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button. Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.The require statement checks a condition and reverts the transaction if it fails. It is commonly used to validate inputs or enforce preconditions. Assert is typically used to check for logical errors or to ensure internal consistency within the contract. If the condition evaluates to false, the transaction is reverted, and any changes made during the execution are discarded.The revert statement is similar to require in that it reverts the transaction. However, it allows developers to provide a custom error message that is returned to the caller. T
